# Contributing

Digital Hub welcomes all contributing and collaborating efforts! We hope to strengthen the data science community in all sectors of work by triggering discussions and thought-processes in different industrial usecases. We would love to have your inputs and make contributing to this repository as easy as possible, whether you are wanting to: 

- Discussing data science usecases and topics
- Submitting new data science resources
- Contributing to existing data science resources
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, notebooks, sample datasets, track issues and discuessions, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the repository (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added notebooks, please indicates requirements and library dependencies at the top of the notebook
3. Ensure that image files, and datasets are placed in proper directories
4. Ensure code within notebooks abides to proper coding conventions
5. Ensure that all code cells pass and runs successfully
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report Bugs and Initialize Discussion on Notebooks Using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/Integradas/DigitalHubCommunity/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Integradas/DigitalHubCommunity/issues/new); it's that easy! For discussions please ensure to follow our code of conducts and let our community thrive with positive energy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
